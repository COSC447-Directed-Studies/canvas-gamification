<p>
    In Java, a semicolon <code>;</code> is used to end statements, but it should not be placed at the end of a method
    header. The semicolon is used to separate statements, while a method header defines the start of a method.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if a programmer mistakenly places a semicolon at the end of a method header, the compiler would raise
    an error:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
public void myMethod(); {
  // code here
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>The correct usage of a method header would be as follows:</p>
<pre>
<code>
public void myMethod() {
  // code here
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    Not having the semicolon at the end of the method header and properly defining the start of the method is important
    for the correct functioning of the code. Misusing the semicolon in this manner can lead to errors in the code.
