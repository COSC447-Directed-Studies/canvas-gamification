<p>
    A "missing return statement" error in Java occurs when a method is declared to return a value, but the method
    doesn't
    have a return statement that returns the required type of value. The Java compiler requires a return statement in
    every non-void method, unless it can prove that all execution paths through the method will eventually return a
    value.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider the following code:</p>
<pre>
int getSum(int a, int b) {
   if (a > b) {
      return a + b;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
    In this code, the `getSum` method is declared to return an `int`, but if `a <= b`, there's no return statement in the
    method and the compiler will raise a "missing return statement" error.
</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>To fix this error, you need to add a return statement in all possible execution paths of the method, like this:</p>
<pre>
int getSum(int a, int b) {
   if (a > b) {
      return a + b;
   } else {
      return 0;
   }
}
</pre>
