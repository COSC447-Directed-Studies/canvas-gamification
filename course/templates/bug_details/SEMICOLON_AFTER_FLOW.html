<p>
    The incorrect usage of a semi-colon after an `if` selection structure before the `if` statement or after the `for`
    or
    `while` repetition structure before the respective loop can result in syntax errors and cause the program to behave
    in unexpected ways.
</p>
<p>For example, consider the following code:</p>
<pre>
<code>
if (condition); {
  // code to be executed if condition is true
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    Here, the semi-colon after the `if` statement terminates the `if` statement, and the code within the curly brackets
    becomes an independent block of code that is executed unconditionally, regardless of whether the condition is true
    or false.
</p>
<p>Similarly, consider the following code:</p>
<pre>
<code>
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++); {
  // code to be executed in each iteration of the loop
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    Here, the semi-colon after the `for` loop terminates the loop and the code within the curly brackets becomes an
    independent block of code that is executed unconditionally, without any repetition.
</p>
<p>
    To avoid these issues, it is important to make sure that the semi-colons are used correctly and only placed after
    the statements that need to be terminated, such as statements within the `if` condition or statements within the
    `for` or `while` loop.
