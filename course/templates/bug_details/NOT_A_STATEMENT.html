<p>The Java compiler raises the "not a statement" error when it encounters a line of code that is not a valid statement.
    There are several reasons why this error can occur:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>When an expression is attempted to be executed as a standalone statement. Expressions are not considered
            statements in Java and must be assigned to a variable or used in a larger statement. For example, the code "<code>1
                + 1;</code>" would raise this error. To resolve the issue, the expression should be used in a larger
            statement, such as "<code>int result = 1 + 1;</code>".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>When a programmer uses keywords as method or variable names. Java has reserved keywords that have a specific
            meaning and cannot be used as names for methods or variables. For example, "<code>int if = 5;</code>" would
            raise a compilation error because "if" is a keyword. Similarly, a method cannot be named after a keyword
            such as "<code>public void while() {...}</code>".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>When parentheses are forgotten after a method call. Parentheses are required after method calls to indicate
            that a method is being executed and to pass any required arguments. For example, the code
            "<code>methodA;</code>" in the following class would raise an error:</p>
        <pre>
public class AClass {
    public void methodA() {
        ...
    }
    public void methodB() {
        // call methodA
        methodA;
    }
}
        </pre>
        <p>To resolve the issue, the parentheses should be added after the method call, like this:
            "<code>methodA();</code>".</p>
    </li>
</ol>
