<p>
    In Java, curly brackets {} and round brackets () have specific uses and misusing them can result in a syntax
    error.
</p>
<p>
    Curly brackets are used to define code blocks and group together statements that belong to the same section of code.
    On the other hand, round brackets are used in control statements such as if, for, and while to define the conditions
    that need to be met for the statement to execute.
</p>
<p>
    Misusing curly brackets instead of round brackets in control statements can lead to a syntax error and cause the code
    to not execute as intended. For example:
</p>
<pre>
if {a > 2}
    System.out.println("This is not correct syntax");
</pre>
<p>
    In the code above, the curly brackets {} are being used instead of round brackets () to define the condition for the
    if statement. This will result in a syntax error as the compiler will not understand the code and will not be able
    to execute it.
</p>
<p>
    To avoid this mistake, it is important to understand the proper usage of curly brackets and round brackets in Java
    and to use them correctly when writing control statements.
