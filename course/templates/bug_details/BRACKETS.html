    In Java, there are three types of brackets used for various purposes: curly brackets <code>{}</code>, round brackets
    <code>()</code>, and square brackets <code>[]</code>. It is important to use these brackets correctly to avoid
    syntax errors and ensure that the code executes as intended.
</p>
<p>
    The correct usage of matching brackets in Java involves properly opening and closing the brackets to define a code
    block or to access elements in an array. For example:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
if (condition) {
  // statements to be executed if the condition is true
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    In the code above, the condition is defined within the round brackets <code>()</code> and the code block to be
    executed if the condition is true is defined within the curly brackets <code>{}</code>. This is the correct way to
    use brackets in a Java <code>if</code> statement.
</p>
<p>
    Another example of correct usage of matching brackets in Java is in a <code>for</code> loop:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
for (int i=0; i&lt;10; i++) {
  // statements to be executed in the loop
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    In the code above, the <code>for</code> loop has three parts: the initialization, the condition, and the increment.
    These three parts are separated by semi-colons <code>;</code> and the code block to be executed in the loop is
    defined within the curly brackets <code>{}</code>.
</p>
<p>
    The correct usage of square brackets <code>[]</code> in Java is for accessing elements in an array. For example:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
System.out.println(numbers[2]); // Output: 3
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    In the code above, the square brackets <code>[]</code> are used to access the third element in the
    <code>numbers</code> array, which is <code>3</code>.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to ensure that all opening brackets have a matching closing bracket and that they are correctly
    nested within each other. For example:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
if (condition1) {
  // statements to be executed if condition1 is true
  if (condition2) {
    // statements to be executed if condition2 is true
  }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    In the code above, the second <code>if</code> statement is nested within the first <code>if</code> statement and both
    have matching opening and closing curly brackets. This is the correct way to use brackets in nested control
    statements in Java.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, the correct usage of matching brackets in Java involves properly opening and closing the brackets to
    define a code block, separating parts of control statements, accessing elements in an array, and correctly nesting
    brackets within each other when needed.
