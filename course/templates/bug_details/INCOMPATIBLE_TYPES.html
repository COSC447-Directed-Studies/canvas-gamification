<p>
    The "Incompatible types" error in Java occurs when you try to assign a value of one type to a variable of another
    type that is not compatible with it. This can happen due to several reasons, including: </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mixing different data types: Java has several built-in data types, and you must use the correct data type for
        each variable or expression. If you try to assign a value of one data type to a variable of another data type,
        the compiler will report an incompatible types error.
    </li>
    <li>
        Incorrect casting: Java allows you to cast a value from one data type to another, but you must be careful when
        doing this, as you can lose precision or cause a runtime error if the cast is not appropriate.
    </li>
    <li>
        Incorrect use of method return values: Java methods can return values of different data types, and it is
        important to use the correct data type when assigning the return value to a variable. If you try to assign a
        return value to a variable of the wrong data type, the compiler will report an incompatible types error.
    </li>
</ul><h2>Example</h2><p>Consider the following code:</p>
<pre>
double d = 10;
</pre>
<p>
    Here, the variable `d` is of type `double` and we are trying to assign an `int` value `10` to it. This will cause a
    "Incompatible types" error because `int` and `double` are not the same type and the assignment cannot be made
    without a type conversion.
</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
    To resolve the "Incompatible types" error, you need to make sure
    that the data types are compatible and perform an explicit type conversion if necessary. You can also use type-safe
    methods and classes to avoid the error. For example:
</p>
<pre>
double d = 10.0;
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
double d = (double) 10;
</pre>
